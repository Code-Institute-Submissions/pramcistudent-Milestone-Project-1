# Code Institute Milestone Project

The goal is to demonstrate the technologies that I have learnt through the User Centric Module provided by the Code Institute. The challenge was to create a frontend only website for a 1960’s Rock Band called, The Monkees. I have used HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to show my ability, skill and understanding of technologies learned so far.

The project was to create a website targeted to fans who would come to the site to see and hear clips from the band’s library, for fans to stay up to date with new content and events as they become available whilst also attracting a new fan base. And to promote the band’s availability to perform at special events.

## UX

The website was designed and created to be focused towards the band’s fan base and new potential fans. 
I have used bright fun colours throughout the site to visually appeal to the user. The colour, style and theme were created to refelective of the persona of the band.
The band has over 50 years experience and numerous chart topping singles along with a large fanbase.

##### User Stories

* As a fan I would like to visit the site to keep up to date with new material releases as it becomes available and to connect with the band via social media.
