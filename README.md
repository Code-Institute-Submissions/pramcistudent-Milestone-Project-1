# Code Institute Milestone Project

The goal is to demonstrate the technologies that I have learnt through the User Centric Module provided by the Code Institute.
The challenge was to create a frontend only website for a 1960’s Rock Band called, The Monkees. I have used HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap to show my ability, skill and understanding of technologies learned so far.
The project was to create a website targeted to fans who would come to the site to see and hear clips from the band’s library, for fans to stay up to date with new content and events as they become available whilst also attracting a new fan base. And to promote the band’s availability to perform at special events.

## UX
The website was designed and created to be focused towards the band’s fan base and potential fans. 
I have used bright fun colours throughout the site to create typography and to visually appeal to the user.
The colour, style and theme were created to reflect the persona of the band as found on the bands offical site [The Monkees](https://www.monkees.com/).
The business requirements are to create a website that is easy to use and allows for sign up's. 
And for fans and potential fans to contact the band to make enquiries about there availability to perform at special events.

### The Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframes & Features
I oringanlly created my wireframes in Balsamiq however I found this to be a little restrictive in terms of the design process as I wanted to show more detail for my first project.
So I choose to switch to a more simpler form and used powerpoint to create and style my wireframes.
